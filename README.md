# fsjs-techdegree-project5

Grabs 12 random users from the randomuser.me API.
Displays each user in a card, that is clickable to bring up a modal window containing more information.
Allows a user to navigate the app by clicking prev/next in the modal window, or by searching the app.

CSS updates:
- Modal close button is custom RGB red in hover state
- Prev and Next buttons are coloured with the same RGB red when at the start/finish of the employee list.
- Prev and Next button text stays white when at the start/finish of the employee list (removing 'clickable' behaviour).
- Subtle grey added to background colour.
